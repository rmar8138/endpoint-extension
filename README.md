# Endpoint Extension

## Purpose

This extension allows you to instantly open a new tab with a preconfigured route.

For example, if your dev team works with admin or management route on a domain, this saves some typing time. The extension will bypass all current routes and open a new tab from the domain's base url.

```
https://www.yourdomain.com/route/anotherroute -> https://www.yourdomain.com/management
```

## Configuration

The default route string is "management". Settings for the preconfigured route can be changed by accessing the extension options page in the extension details, which is displayed in chrome://extensions/.
